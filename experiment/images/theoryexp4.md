# Position analysis of NonGrashof four bar mechanism

## Learning objectives

<p>After completing the simulation experiments on fourbar Non-Grash of mechanism one should be able to </p>

* Determine the location CG of any given link in a Non-Grashof four bar mechanism
* Determine the output link angle of a Non-Grashof four bar mechanism for any given crank angle
* Calculate the transmission angle of a given Non-Grashof four bar mechanism at any given crank angle

* Synthesize length of a Non-Grashof four bar mechanism for a given conditions

## Introduction

A four bar mechanism consists of four rigid link which are linked in the form of quadrilateral by four pin joints. A link that makes complete revolution is called crank, the link opposite to the fixed link is the coupler and forth link is a lever or rocker if oscillates or another crank if rotates.
